<!--
block comments for html and outside of
dedicated sections can go in sections like this
-->
<!--
This is how you set a class (using  .class_name{
settings;
} )
Here I created a class called memory_box and set the
style to have a certain background colour, width and height
  -->
<style>
  .memory_box{
background-color:orange;
width:200px;
height:200px;
  }
</style>

<!--
headers can go inside <h1></h1> tags - you can change the 1
to other numbers to change the size of the font
-->
<h1>Carolyn's website</h1>

<!--
Lines of text can be separated by <div></div>
you can put multiple statements on the same line using <span></span>
Within these tags, you can specify class, style and other things
-->
<div>A magpie stole my cat's shrew</div>
<span>First part of this line</span>
<span style =color:blue>second part of this line</span>
<div class="">And this is a different line
</div>

<!--
Here we create a table using <table></table>
<tr></tr> defines a new table row
<td></td> defines a new table colomn
we can give each cell an id that we can refer to later
-->
<table class="">
  <tr>
    <td><div id="box0"  class = "memory_box" ></div></td>
    <td><div id="box1" class="memory_box"></div></td>
    <td><div id="box2" class="memory_box"></div></td>
    <td><div id="box3" class="memory_box"></div></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div id="box4" class="memory_box"></div></td>
    <td><div id="box5" class="memory_box"></div></td>
    <td><div id="box6" class="memory_box"></div></td>
    <td><div id="box7" class="memory_box"></div></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<!--
Now onto some javascript
javascript is what makes your page interactive!
We start the script by using the <script></script> tags and you
can specify text/javascript to make it easy to follow
-->
<script type="text/javascript">
  /*
  block comments within javascript look like this
  */
  //single line comments within javascript look like this

  /*
  We can create alerts that pop up on the website when it is opened
  to do this, we can use alert()
  */
  howdy="Gee I feel bad. My girlfriend is so lovely and I shouted at her";
  alert(howdy);

  /*
  Variables should be defined using var - this makes your script nice and
  tidy
  */
  //an object can store multiple variables - to call the different parts
  //of an object, use the . e.g. obj.something
  var card_obj = {
    card_letters: ["a", "b", "c", "d", "a", "b", "c", "d"],
    visible_letters: [],
    selected_boxes: []
  }

  /*
  If you want to include something in the webpage log, you can use
  console.log to add it in
  */
  console.log(card_obj.card_letters);
  card_obj;
</script>
